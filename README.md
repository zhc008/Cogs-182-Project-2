# Cogs-182-Project-2
The notebook conatins the environment for the 2*2 Rubik's cube, and all my implementation for the algorithms.
The blocks in the notebook can be run sequentially. The enviornment is built into functions, and they are at the beginning of the notebook. After those, there are my attempt for doing linear function approximation. The two tabular algorithms are implemented after the text block 'Part II'. Among the blocks, there are some test blocks that I used to display and check the results from my function.
